Static JSON list of fake users is in this repository ([`users.json`](users.json)).

Please share your solution with us in the form of a public Git repository.

### Tasks

* Implement the given UI on a level of detail you deem necessary. Feel free to pick your own UI framework and libraries, preferrably something that is widely used like Vue or React, etc.
* UI has to be performant - feel free pick your approach on loading the data like creating a light dummy API interface around it or something totally different.

### Bonus
* Host it somewhere - the choice is yours.
